This resume was made in this format for one major reason- in my career (eResearch/ Research Software Engineer), I've collected an eclectic range of skills, focusing on how to solve a problem. However, it was hard to find a resume template that covered each area, but offered the ability to highlight subsets of skills- so I made one.

This collection of skills happened for three reasons:
1. In my industry, there is no set 'career path' (I found the Pivot method the closest to aplicable career planning)
2. Over the years, researchers have approached me with unique problems or opportunities and I've learnt these skills to solve/implement them
3. I've found concepts/ideas/technology that has interested me and the was an opportunity to benefit from it.

I also may implement this as a part 2 of https://amandamiotto.github.io/ResumeLesson/ in the future.
